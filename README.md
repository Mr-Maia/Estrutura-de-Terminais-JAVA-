# Terminal Network Management 

## Project Description

This project aims to develop an application that functions as the manager of a communication terminal network, referred to as "prr." Broadly, the program allows for the management and retrieval of information related to clients, terminals, and communications. Specifically, the system offers various services to its users, including:

1. Registering client data.
2. Registering terminal data.
3. Recording information about communications.
4. Conducting searches on completed communications.
5. Calculating the balance associated with terminals.

This README provides an overview of the project's entities, functionalities, and design requirements.

## Entities in the Domain

In this section, we describe the various entities that will be manipulated within the context of the application to be developed. Key concepts in this context include:

- **Network of Terminals**: The overarching network of communication terminals.
- **Client**: Users of the network.
- **Communication**: Records of communication activities.
- **Terminal**: Devices within the network.

Clients, terminals, and communications possess unique identifiers, represented as strings for clients and terminals, and integers for communications. Each network of terminals, client, and terminal has a specific balance, defined as the difference between payments made and outstanding debts, considering the context of the entity.

- The network of terminals' balance is calculated as the sum of the balances of its clients.
- A client's balance takes into account the balances of its various terminals.
- A terminal's balance is the difference between the cost of communications that have been paid and those that are outstanding.

Please note that in the implementation of this application, it may be necessary to consider additional concepts beyond those explicitly identified in this section.

## Functionality

The application provides the following key functionalities:

1. **Client Management**:
   - Register new clients.
   - Update client information.
   - Retrieve client details.

2. **Terminal Management**:
   - Register new terminals.
   - Update terminal information.
   - Retrieve terminal details.

3. **Communication Management**:
   - Record communication activities.
   - Calculate communication costs.
   - Retrieve communication records.

4. **Balance Calculation**:
   - Calculate and update balances for clients, terminals, and networks of terminals.

5. **Search and Reporting**:
   - Search for communications by various criteria.
   - Generate reports on communication activities.

## Design Requirements

The application should adhere to the following design requirements:

- Ensure data integrity and validation for all user inputs.
- Provide a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for easy interaction.
- Implement robust error handling and reporting.
- Optimize performance for large datasets if applicable.
- Ensure code modularity and maintainability.
